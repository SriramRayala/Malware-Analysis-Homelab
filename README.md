# Malware-Analysis-Homelab

Introduction

Building the right malware analysis environment is the first step for every malware researcher. When all system configurations and software installations are complete, youâ€™re able to analyze and investigate malware properly. I wanted to share my own experiences and scripts to help ease the workload of setting up a malware environment to explore malicious software.

We will learn how to:

Download, install and configure a free Windows 10 and a free REMnux Linux virtual machine

Set up a virtual private network for communication between virtual machines

Build a custom Windows malware environment with FlareVm Tools

Analyzing Trojans using our Malware Lab Setup

INFO: 

Basically we create  our own virtual isolated network making sure that we compartmentalize malware when its detonated , we are dissecting malware, disabling  windows defender , Setting up remnux  act as a c2 server to impersonate the dns service. Topology - using virtual box as our hypervisor  to create and manage our  Virtual machines and network settings, total 2 virtual machines one is FLAREVM  this is where we detonate our malware  and assess it  and this FLAREVM also impersonates a random windows 10 workstation just a default windows 10 with some malware analysis tools installed and then virtual machine number 2 is going to be our c2 server which is REMNUX and ultimately we are going to create an isolated network  in the 10 block address space  and this is going to be completely isolated from environment . Vm1 which is FLAREVM and VM2  which is REMNUX can talk to each other but cant talk to anything else outside internet. After this setup we will Analyze a Trojan with Static, Advanced Static Analysis, Dynamic analysis, Define its characteristics, Along with Reporting IOCs( by writing a YARA rule ).Some of the Overall Analysis Tools include ( virus total, PESTUDIO, FLOSS, CAPA, CUTTER, INetSim, WIRESHARK, Procmon, YARA). This project helps us equip with right set of tools, methodolgy  and knowledge  to go out and dissect  our own malware
